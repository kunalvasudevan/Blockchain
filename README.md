A blockchain is a public ledger to which everyone has access
but without a central authority having control. It is an enabling
technology for individuals and companies to collaborate with
trust and transparency. One of the best know applications of
blockchains are the cryptographic currencies such as Bitcoin
and others, but many other applications are possible. Blockchain
technology is considered to be the driving force of the next
fundamental revolution in information technology. Many implementations
of blockchain technology are widely available today, each having
its particular strength for a specific application domain. The
tutorial provides the participants with insights and practical
experience on Blockchain technology and applications in practice,
as well as theory based exploration of possible business cases.
